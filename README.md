Pytorch-template

This is a template for semantic segmentation projects in Pytorch, but it can be easilly adapted to other cases.
In this example, the Cityscapes dataset is used (it must be downloaded first). The netowrk used is a predefined DeepLabv3 available from the torchvision package.

This template includes:
1) Learning rate finder
2) Read parameters from configuration file
3) Logging into log file
4) Tensorboard summary for learning rate, loss, metrics
